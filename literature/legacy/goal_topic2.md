Goal: use align-- Look for Speculative decoding [Auditor model] >> alignment is loaded & not changing base model [Plug & play model] as seperate wrapper

step1: use Ecliptica dataset, 
step2: train different [pluggable] auditor model/ speculative decoding [tournament sampling] >> no frozen alignment backbone
